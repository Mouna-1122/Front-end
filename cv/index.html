    <h2>Career objective</h2>
    <p>As a third year engineering student with a strong foundation in mathematics, programming. I am seeking opportunities to apply and
deepen my skills as a full stack developer. as well as i am also interested in computer networking i have engaged myself in learning
computer Networks</p>
    <h2>work Experience</h2>
    <p>AI & Cloud Technologies • Internship Jul 2025 - Aug 2025
IBM SkillsBuild & Edunet Foundation, Virtual
During this internship, I developed and deployed a project titled “Predicting Eligibility for the National Social Assistance Program (NSAP)
Using Machine Learning.” The project aimed to create an AI-driven system capable of predicting the eligibility of individuals for specific
welfare schemes under NSAP based on demographic, socio-economic, and financial parameters. Leveraging machine-learning
algorithms deployed on the IBM Cloud, the system automated decision-making, improved accuracy, and reduced manual errors in
benefit distribution. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills in machine learning and cloud-based development but
also deepened my understanding of how data-driven intelligence can promote social inclusion and effective governance. Through
continuous mentorship and real-world problem-solving, I successfully transformed theoretical AI knowledge into a tangible, socially
impactful solution.</p>
